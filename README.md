Imperial College London Simulation Methods 

To open the project, use CLion (https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/), which is freely available for students.

Building everything should be simple, but if you want, you can run the following cmake command:

"C:\Program Files\JetBrains\CLion 2017.3.1\bin\cmake\bin\cmake.exe" --build C:\Users\jdcbr\CLionProjects\simulationmethods\cmake-build-debug --target all -- -j 2

You should be able to use any cmake binary you may have available.
